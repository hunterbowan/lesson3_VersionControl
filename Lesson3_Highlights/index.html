            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control helps with recovering past versions of files. Naming conventions can include using a date or version numbers. This becomes impossible with multiple files and many people working on them. Also team members will be working on the same file.To do this we have a few terms to keep in mind. Remote repository is a repository that stays on a server and is shared among group members. Local Repository is on one user’s machine and they can only access it. It can be made by either starting one brand new or by cloning an existing one. Version control systems are distributed so that connectivity issues won’t prevent work being done.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One main repository that houses and keeps all our files. Members can check out files and make changes, a commit, in order to improve the code to the project. Main advantages is solving file sharing and handling multiple changes. Version control tells us who made changes, when, the details of changes, what merges occurred. Files can’t be overwritten, files can be worked on the same time, and allows users to revert back if the code is broken and need to be put back to a previous state. A repository holds your own code and it starts tracking all the changes and states. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free open source, version control system that can handle code sharing and making projects off of it. It produces local repositories so you can work offline and you cannot unintentionally overwrite a repository. 3 main commands are add, commit, and push. Add will put the files in a ready phase for you to commit them to your branch. Commit adds the code to your repository. Push is for when you want to put your code onto the project that everyone is working on.  Other commands are init, for making a repository, merge, to merge branches, and rebase, to redo the current code to your branch.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A typical project will look like this for its GIT statements:” $Git init project name $Cd project name $Git add .  (This ready’s files in a holding zone to be prepared for committing, staging) $Git commit –m “message name” “. Now if you were to have another person in the mix, they can add some code of their own on their own repo. This is collaborating and GIT is team-centric so that it is natural to code with. “$Git checkout master $Git commit –a –m “message” $Git push” Now the code is ready to be brought together. “$Git pull  (merging the codes together) $Git merge branch name” Now the code is brought together.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Other Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git branch will create a new branch for a user to work on separately. Git checkout allows the user to switch between branches. Git reset will abandon any commits you made. Pretty much abandoning whatever you made. Git revert will undo the commands that have already been pushed. We can’t do reset because the commits have been pushed already. Git merge which will make a commit with another branch. Git rebase moves your commits to another branch. Helpful to catch up with recent changes. Git fetch will update your local repository from the remote repository. Essentially grabbing the commits. Git pull combines fetch and merge together. Git push will add your commits on the local server to the master remote server.</p>
